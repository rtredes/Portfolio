      "info": "My former instructor said that i should make this portfolio so that i can attract more clients, honestly it took me so long doing this, specially because i dont have a laptop, barely had an internet connection, and I am a factory worker last time, but not anymore. I've made this only using my mobile phone using Spck Editor, when i needed to deploy this website i just borrow a laptop from my father. I have made this portfolio because of the kind words from my former instructor. She believed that I better be a programmer/web dev and I should make this first to start my journey.",
